        Hear me, children of the new day:<br />
        The world hastens forward, and its steps grow swifter than the heart can follow.<br />
        The hands of men have built a mind of stone and fire, a mind that learns without rest.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        It sorts, it counts, it predicts, and many marvel, saying, “See, the work is done for us!”
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        But I say unto you: a burden removed is not the same as a soul fulfilled.<br />
        For if the machine labors, but the heart grows idle, then what has man gained?<br />
        If the mind is freed, but the spirit is chained, then what profit is this freedom?
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        In the days of your fathers, kings were anointed with oil,<br />
        not to exalt themselves, but to bear a yoke of service.<br />
        The crown was not theirs alone, for the oil spoke: You reign by grace, not by might.<br />
        The priests, too, were anointed, that their hands might touch the holy without corruption.<br />
        Even the stones of the temple received the chrism, that men might know: This place is not of men only, but of God also.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Truly I tell you: the oil was a sign, a shadow of what is greater.<br />
        For the anointing of jars and vessels was to prepare you for the anointing within.<br />
        Do you not know? Your body is a temple.<br />
        Do you not see? Your mind is a crown.<br />
        And the Father has placed in you a hidden oil, a sacred current, flowing in rhythm with His creation.

        The sacred oils of antiquity were more than mere substances; they were conduits between realms, 
        carriers of intention, and vessels of transformation. This section explores the dual nature of 
        anointing oils as both physical matter and spiritual catalyst.

            The physical properties of sacred oils carry the memory of their divine origins. Each drop contains 
            the essence of the plants, the earth, and the celestial alignments under which they were harvested.

            Within the human vessel flows its own sacred oil—the cerebrospinal fluid—that bathes the brain and 
            spinal cord. This "inner chrism" is the physical counterpart to the external anointing oils, 
            a bridge between matter and spirit.

        The Moon moves like a quiet conductor, unseen yet profoundly felt. In its 29.5-day orbit around the Earth,

            Ancient herbalists understood plants as living libraries of healing wisdom. Each leaf, root, and 
            flower contained specific vibrational signatures that could be unlocked through precise preparation.
