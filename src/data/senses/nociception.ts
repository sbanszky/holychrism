      <p class="text-amber-200">Some senses show you beauty.<br><strong>Nociception shows you boundaries.</strong></p>
      <p class="text-amber-200">It is the sense of pain — or more precisely, the detection of <strong>actual or potential tissue damage.</strong></p>
      <p class="text-amber-200">Without it, life would be short. People born with congenital insensitivity to pain often suffer severe burns, fractures, or infections because they never learn to protect their bodies. Pain is not a flaw — it is <strong>a survival language</strong>, a primal alarm system etched into the nervous system.</p>
      <p class="text-amber-200">But nociception is more than warning. It is also <strong>teaching</strong>: it shows where you end, where the world begins, and how to move through that boundary with respect.</p>

      <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-amber-300 mt-4 mb-2">The Outer Function — The Body’s Alarm Network</h4>
      <p class="text-amber-200">Nociception is not a single pathway but a <strong>network of specialized free nerve endings</strong> distributed throughout the skin, muscles, joints, bones, and viscera. These <strong>nociceptors</strong> come in several types:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-amber-200 pl-4">
        <li><strong>Thermal nociceptors:</strong> Aδ fibers, respond to extreme heat or cold</li>
        <li><strong>Mechanical nociceptors:</strong> Aδ fibers, respond to sharp pressure or cutting</li>
        <li><strong>Polymodal nociceptors:</strong> C fibers, respond to chemical irritants, inflammation, or sustained pressure</li>
        <li><strong>Silent nociceptors:</strong> Become active only during inflammation</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-amber-200">Signals travel through <strong>Aδ (fast, sharp pain)</strong> and <strong>C (slow, dull pain)</strong> fibers to the <strong>dorsal horn of the spinal cord</strong>, where they synapse in <strong>lamina I and II</strong>. From there they ascend via the <strong>spinothalamic tract</strong> to the <strong>thalamus</strong>, <strong>somatosensory cortex (S1)</strong>, <strong>insula</strong>, and <strong>anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)</strong> — the brain’s pain matrix.</p>
      <p class="text-amber-200">While S1 registers pain’s <strong>location and intensity</strong>, the insula and ACC generate its <strong>emotional unpleasantness</strong> and urge to escape. This duality makes pain impossible to ignore.</p>
      
      <hr class="my-4 border-amber-800">
      
      <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-amber-300 mt-4 mb-2">Protective Reflexes</h4>
      <p class="text-amber-200">Nociception triggers <strong>spinal withdrawal reflexes</strong> even before signals reach the brain. Touch a hot stove, and your hand jerks away within 70 milliseconds — faster than conscious thought. This reflex arc bypasses cortical processing to prioritize survival.</p>
      <p class="text-amber-200">Pain also drives <strong>learning</strong>: the brain remembers painful events to avoid repetition. This forms the root of <strong>aversive conditioning</strong>, an essential component of behavior and habit formation.</p>
