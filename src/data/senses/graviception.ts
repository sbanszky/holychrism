        <p>Proprioception tells you where your body is.<br>Kinesthesia tells you how it moves.<br><strong>Graviception tells you that you are being held.</strong></p>
        <p class="mt-4">It is the silent sense of weight — the body's constant dialogue with the pull of the Earth. Gravity presses on you at every moment, shaping posture, muscle tone, and orientation. Without it, there would be no up or down, no falling or standing, no meaning to balance or movement.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">Graviception is rarely named, yet it underlies all action. It is the invisible floor beneath consciousness — and the reminder that <strong>we belong to a planet.</strong></p>

        <h4 class="text-lg font-bold text-amber-300 mt-6 mb-2">The Outer Function — Sensing Gravity Itself</h4>
        
        <p>Graviception overlaps with but is distinct from equilibrioception. Balance senses orientation; graviception senses <strong>load</strong> — the body's weight pressing into support surfaces.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">This information comes from several sources:</p>
        
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mt-4">
          <li><strong>Otolith organs (utricle, saccule)</strong> in the vestibular system detect the constant acceleration of gravity (~9.81 m/s²). Their tiny calcium carbonate crystals bend hair cells under gravity's pull, signaling head tilt.</li>
          <li><strong>Muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs</strong> detect constant muscle tension required to counteract gravity.</li>
          <li><strong>Cutaneous mechanoreceptors</strong> in the soles of the feet and other contact points detect pressure gradients from weight-bearing.</li>
          <li><strong>Baroreceptors and visceral stretch receptors</strong> sense blood shifting downward under gravity, regulating circulation.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="mt-4">The brain integrates these inputs in the <strong>vestibular nuclei, cerebellum, and parietal cortex</strong>, generating an ever-present sense of downness and body weight.</p>
