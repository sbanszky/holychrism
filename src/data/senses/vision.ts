      <p class="text-amber-200 leading-relaxed">
        Vision is the most celebrated of the human senses, and for many, the one most closely identified with knowledge itself. To see is to know. The human eye, a sphere of transparent cornea, crystalline lens, and photoreceptive retina, is often likened to a camera. But this metaphor falls short. Unlike a mechanical camera, which passively records, the eye is part of a living brain. It does not merely capture photons; it interprets them, weaving them into meaning, memory, and emotion.

        The retina itself is not a passive screen but neural tissue — an extension of the central nervous system. It is lined with two types of photoreceptors: rods and cones. Rods, about 120 million in each eye, are highly sensitive to light and motion, enabling us to see in dim conditions. Cones, fewer in number (~6 million), allow color vision and fine detail, divided into red, green, and blue-sensitive subtypes. Together, rods and cones transmute photons into electrical signals, which travel through the optic nerve to the brain’s visual cortex.

        Yet even this is only part of the story. Visual processing does not occur in a single location. Roughly one-third of the human brain is devoted to visual interpretation. Information fans out into dozens of specialized regions — some for detecting edges, others for motion, color, faces, or spatial depth. This distributed architecture reveals an important truth: seeing is not a single act but a symphony of neural transformations.
