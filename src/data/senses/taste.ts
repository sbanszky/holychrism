      <p class="text-amber-200 mb-4">If smell is the alchemy of air, taste is the alchemy of matter. It is the sense that decides what the body allows to become part of itself. Through taste, we discern what nourishes, what harms, and what delights. Every bite is a crossroads: the world becomes the body, or it is rejected.</p>
      
      <p class="text-amber-200 mb-4">Taste is our most intimate form of perception. Light and sound can be observed from a distance; smells drift at arm’s length. But taste requires touching the world with the tongue, dissolving it in saliva, and letting it cross the boundary of the self. It is a sacred trust — and one of the primal roots of pleasure.</p>
      
      <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-amber-300 mb-3">The Outer Function – Chemistry as Perception</h4>
      
      <p class="text-amber-200 mb-4">Taste begins with chemoreceptors on the tongue and soft palate. Humans have around 5,000–10,000 taste buds, each containing 50–150 taste receptor cells. These are clustered mainly on the papillae of the tongue: fungiform (front), foliate (sides), and circumvallate (back).</p>
      
      <p class="text-amber-200">Each taste bud opens to the surface through a tiny pore. Molecules from food dissolve in saliva and enter the pore, binding to receptor proteins. This triggers electrical signals that travel through three cranial nerves — the facial (VII), glossopharyngeal (IX), and vagus (X) — to the nucleus of the solitary tract in the brainstem, then to the thalamus, and finally to the gustatory cortex in the insula.</p>
      
      <p class="text-amber-200">Humans detect at least five universally accepted basic tastes:</p>
