      <p class="text-amber-200 leading-relaxed">
        If sight is the sovereign of light, then hearing is the sovereign of vibration. Where the eye parses photons and patterns of illumination, the ear becomes the temple of resonance, translating waves of pressure in the air into meaning, memory, and emotion. To hear is to stand at the threshold between silence and song, between chaos and rhythm. It is to participate in a world that is perpetually moving, vibrating, humming—because at its root, reality is vibration.

      <h4 class="text-lg font-bold text-amber-300 mt-4 mb-2">The Physics of Sound</h4>
      
      <p class="text-amber-200 leading-relaxed">
        Sound begins as movement. A plucked string, a struck drum, a human voice exhaling across vocal cords: each disturbs the air, compressing and expanding it in microscopic ripples. These ripples radiate outward like circles on water, invisible yet tangible. They travel as longitudinal waves, alternating zones of high and low pressure, until they reach the sensitive architecture of the human ear.

      <p class="text-amber-200 leading-relaxed mt-4">
        The human auditory system is a marvel of biological engineering. The outer ear, with its curves and ridges, funnels sound toward the tympanic membrane. The middle ear, with its tiny bones—the malleus, incus, and stapes—amplifies the vibrations. Finally, the inner ear converts mechanical pressure into neural signals: the cochlea, coiled like a nautilus shell, houses thousands of hair cells tuned to specific frequencies. Each hair cell bends in rhythm with its preferred vibration, firing signals along the auditory nerve toward the brain.

        This is the mechanical side of hearing, but what the brain does with these signals is more astonishing. Within milliseconds, the brain can detect pitch, timbre, direction, and rhythm. It can recognize the difference between a mother’s whisper and a thunderclap, a violin and a cello, a laugh and a sob. Hearing is not passive reception—it is constant interpretation, pattern recognition, and prediction.
