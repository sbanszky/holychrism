      <p class="text-amber-200">Touch tells you that something is in contact with you.</p>
      <p class="text-amber-200">Thermoception tells you what temperature it carries.</p>
      <p class="text-amber-200">It is the sense that lets you feel the sun’s warmth on your skin, the bite of winter air on your face, the comfort of a mug between your palms, or the danger of a too-hot stove. Thermoception does not see or hear — it judges the energetic state of matter itself.</p>
      <p class="text-amber-200">This is the sense that lets you know if the world is safe to approach, nourishing to embrace, or dangerous to touch. It is the elemental language of fire and frost.</p>
      
      <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-amber-300 mt-4 mb-2">The Outer Function — Temperature Receptors of the Skin</h4>
      <p class="text-amber-200">Thermoception is mediated by free nerve endings in the skin, specialized into two main classes:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-amber-200 pl-4">
        <li><strong>Cold receptors (Aδ fibers)</strong>: Thinly myelinated, fast-conducting, respond to cooling from ~35°C down to 10°C.</li>
        <li><strong>Warm receptors (C fibers)</strong>: Unmyelinated, slower-conducting, respond to warming from ~30°C up to about 45°C.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-amber-200">Below ~10°C or above ~45°C, nociceptors (pain receptors) activate to warn of tissue damage — which is why extreme cold and extreme heat can feel paradoxically similar as “burning.”</p>
      <p class="text-amber-200">These thermoreceptors send signals to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, then up the spinothalamic tract to the thalamus and somatosensory cortex (S1). Integration also occurs in the insular cortex, which ties temperature sensation to emotional and autonomic responses.</p>
      <p class="text-amber-200">Thermoception is relative, not absolute: receptors adapt quickly to sustained temperature, making changes especially salient. This is why stepping from a warm room into winter air feels shocking, but becomes tolerable after a minute.</p>
      
      <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-amber-300 mt-4 mb-2">Thermal Maps of the Body</h4>
      <p class="text-amber-200">Different body regions vary in thermal sensitivity. The face, lips, fingertips, and genitals are highly temperature-sensitive, while the back is less so. This distribution reflects the density of thermoreceptors and the evolutionary need to protect vital areas.</p>
      <p class="text-amber-200">Thermoception also supports homeostasis by triggering reflexes: shivering to generate heat, vasodilation to shed heat, sweating to cool. These are partly driven by skin temperature sensors feeding the hypothalamus, the body’s thermostat.</p>
      <p class="text-amber-200">Thus, thermoception is not just about perception — it is about regulation.</p>
