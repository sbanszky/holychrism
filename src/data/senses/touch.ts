      <p class="text-amber-200 mb-4">
        Sight observes. Hearing receives. Smell remembers. Taste discerns.<br>
        But touch confirms.
      </p>
      
      <p class="text-amber-200 mb-4">
        It is the first sense to awaken in the womb and the last to fade at death. Before the eyes open or the ears attune, 
        the skin already feels — pressure, warmth, movement, vibration. Touch is the foundation upon which all other senses build. 
        Without it, we could not stand, move, or even know where our body ends and the world begins.
      </p>
      
      <p class="text-amber-200 mb-4">
        Touch is the most extensive sense of all. It blankets us, a living boundary between self and universe. 
        Yet it is more than boundary — it is bridge. Through touch, the world becomes intimate, and the self becomes real.
      </p>
      
      <h4 class="text-lg font-bold text-amber-300 mb-2 mt-6">The Outer Function — The Somatosensory System</h4>
      
      <p class="text-amber-200 mb-4">
        Touch is not one sense but a family of submodalities collectively called somatosensation.
      </p>
      
      <p class="text-amber-200 mb-4">
        The skin contains a sophisticated network of mechanoreceptors, thermoreceptors, and nociceptors, 
        each tuned to specific kinds of stimuli:
      </p>
      
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-amber-200 mb-4">
        <li class="mb-2">
          <strong>Merkel cells</strong> — slow-adapting receptors that detect pressure and fine texture.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
          <strong>Meissner corpuscles</strong> — fast-adapting receptors sensitive to light touch and flutter.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
          <strong>Pacinian corpuscles</strong> — deep receptors detecting vibration.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
          <strong>Ruffini endings</strong> — sense skin stretch and sustained pressure.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Free nerve endings</strong> — detect pain, temperature, and itch.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p class="text-amber-200 mb-4">
        Signals travel via Aβ (touch), Aδ (fast pain/cold), and C (slow pain/warm) fibers to the dorsal root ganglia, 
        then up the dorsal column–medial lemniscal pathway to the somatosensory cortex (S1). The brain maintains a 
        sensory homunculus — a distorted body map where lips, hands, and genitals loom large due to their dense innervation.
      </p>
      
      <p class="text-amber-200">
        Touch also includes deep somatosensation: receptors in muscles, tendons, and joints provide pressure and 
        stretch information to guide movement.
      </p>
      
      <p class="text-amber-200 mt-4">
        This system operates continuously, mostly below awareness, composing the silent symphony of embodiment.
