          The ancients spoke of five senses, yet the human body is not limited to five gates. Modern science reveals at least fifteen, and esoteric traditions have always known the body is a constellation of subtle antennas, each tuned to different frequencies of existence.
        </p>
        
        <p class="text-amber-200 leading-relaxed">
          Where sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch open the world’s outer doors, the hidden senses reveal inner corridors. They are the quiet keepers of balance, pain, temperature, orientation, and time. They tell us not only where we are in the cosmos, but also who we are in the flesh. To neglect them is to walk half-blind; to honor them is to master the temple of perception.
        </p>
        
        <p class="text-amber-200 leading-relaxed">
          Just as light and sound guide the outer priest, these hidden senses guide the inner alchemist. They do not shout — they whisper. And when cultivated, they expand awareness beyond the ordinary, offering both survival intelligence and mystical insight.
