      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-amber-300 mb-4">The Sun: Fire of the Inner and Outer Worlds</h3>
      <p class="text-amber-200 mb-4">
        Beyond the oils, herbs, and lunar rhythms lies the Sun—the primal fire of existence. Its light is not just photons; it is a metaphor and mechanism for transformation. The Sun ignites life on Earth, drives cycles of energy, and fuels consciousness. Within humans, it mirrors the inner fire: creativity, vitality, intuition, and the courage to act.
      </p>
      <p class="text-amber-200 mb-4">
        The Sun can burn harder than any explosion because it is not limited to matter—it is the intensity of awareness, of conscious focus, of aligned energy. A human who preserves their inner chrism, aligns with the Moon, and cultivates the Earth gifts carries a miniature Sun within. This fire can transform fear into insight, inertia into action, and potential into manifestation.
      </p>
      <p class="text-amber-200 mb-4">
        Solar alignment amplifies the inner temple: morning light stimulates cortisol and circadian rhythm, meditation at sunrise aligns the mind with external energy, and intentional exposure to natural sunlight becomes a tool for neural calibration. The hidden Sun teaches that ultimate fire is not destruction—it is illumination, presence, and clarity.
      </p>
      <p class="text-amber-200 mb-4">
        To cultivate your inner Sun:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-4 text-left mx-auto max-w-lg">
        <li>Begin the day with light awareness, inhaling deeply, feeling energy pulse</li>
        <li>Visualize the inner fire rising, warming the body, and illuminating thought</li>
        <li>Act with intention, letting the inner Sun guide focus, creativity, and compassion</li>
        <li>Align external action with inner purpose, integrating solar rhythm with neural rhythm</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-amber-200">
        The Sun is a reminder that true energy is conscious, sustainable, and radiant. Preserved inner fire, like the inner chrism, is a source of limitless potential, waiting for those who recognize, nurture, and respect it.
