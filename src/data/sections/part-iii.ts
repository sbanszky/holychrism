      Earth offers medicine, fragrance, and ritual. Each plant, root, and resin carries properties that resonate with
      body and mind. The Exodus 30 formula—olive oil, myrrh, cinnamon, cassia, calamus—is not mere tradition
      but a blueprint for aligning human physiology and consciousness.
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-4">
      <li><strong>Myrrh:</strong> Endurance, preservation, transformation of sorrow into wisdom.</li>
      <li><strong>Cinnamon:</strong> Passion, energy, circulation, devotion, and inner fire.</li>
      <li><strong>Cassia:</strong> Sovereignty, dignity, balance of influence, grounding.</li>
      <li><strong>Calamus:</strong> Clarity, posture, channel for inner currents.</li>
      <li><strong>Olive Oil:</strong> Vessel, carrier, embodiment of Earth’s sun and nourishment.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Herbs are linked to zodiac energies: ginger and cayenne for Aries, rose and thyme for Taurus, lavender for
      Gemini, lotus for Cancer, cinnamon for Leo, fennel for Virgo, vanilla for Libra, wormwood for Scorpio, sage
      for Sagittarius, cedar for Capricorn, frankincense for Aquarius, sandalwood for Pisces.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Virtues mirror herbs: endurance, passion, dignity, clarity, humility. Cultivation of these qualities preserves
      the inner chrism. Applying oils, consuming herbs, and cultivating virtues are all part of a living practice that
      aligns body, mind, and cosmic rhythm.
