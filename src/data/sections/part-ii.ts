    <p class="mb-4">
      The Moon is not just a celestial body—it is a mirror of inner tides, a clock for the sacred rhythms of life. Its
      phases—New, First Quarter, Full, and Last Quarter—guide the flow of the inner chrism.
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-4">
      <li><strong>New Moon:</strong> Gather potential, plant intentions, nurture inner oil.</li>
      <li><strong>First Quarter:</strong> Test, act, observe how energy flows and shifts.</li>
      <li><strong>Full Moon:</strong> Illuminate, integrate, and harness peak clarity.</li>
      <li><strong>Last Quarter:</strong> Release, reflect, and prepare for the next cycle.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Zodiac transits color the experience: Aries sparks courage, Taurus stabilizes, Gemini weaves curiosity,
      Cancer deepens emotion, Leo ignites creativity, Virgo sharpens precision, Libra balances, Scorpio
      transforms, Sagittarius expands, Capricorn grounds, Aquarius inspires innovation, Pisces invites surrender.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Practical alignment requires observation: journal under the New Moon, meditate under the First Quarter,
      use herbs and oils to amplify the cycles, track your body and mind’s response. The lunar map is not
      superstition—it is a guide to attuning human biology to cosmic rhythm. Those who cultivate awareness of
      the Moon and its influence can navigate life with clarity, timing, and balance, aligning inner secretion with
      outer rhythm.
