      The Triple Anointing layers the Earth, Moon, and Spirit to create a living temple:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-4">
      <li><strong>Earth:</strong> Oils and herbs awaken pathways in the nervous system, stimulating courage, focus, and nourishment.</li>
      <li><strong>Moon:</strong> Lunar cycles guide inner secretion, timing meditation, journaling, and reflection.</li>
      <li><strong>Spirit:</strong> The inner chrism pulses with neurochemical and subtle resonance, elevating perception and insight.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Integration is a practice: aligning rituals with lunar timing, using herbs and oils intentionally, cultivating
      virtues, and maintaining posture and breath awareness. The human becomes a conscious node, a priest of
      their own neural cathedral, synchronizing inner processes with cosmic rhythm. The Triple Anointing is a
      protocol for evolution, an operational system for body, mind, and spirit.
