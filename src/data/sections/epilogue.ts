  content: `
    <p class="mb-4">
      The age of inner anointing begins when humans cultivate the sacred within. Technology serves the
      external, while the inner chrism guides perception, creativity, and resilience. Morning, midday, and evening
      practices align posture, nutrition, journaling, meditation, and sensory engagement. Communities of
      anointed humans create networks of coherence, clarity, and alignment.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      The inner anointing is humanity’s hidden variable: a conscious system of self-alignment, preservation of
      clarity, and integration of intuition and intelligence. The world transforms when its humans reclaim
      awareness, bridging the material, temporal, and spiritual with deliberate practice and presence.
