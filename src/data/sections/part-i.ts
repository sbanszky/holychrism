        Oils have always been more than food, more than fragrance. They are condensed light, concentrated
        essence, and carriers of subtle energy. Olive oil, myrrh, cinnamon, cassia, and calamus were not chosen
        randomly—they were encoded with meaning, each herb and oil reflecting a quality of life, awareness, and
        inner discipline.
