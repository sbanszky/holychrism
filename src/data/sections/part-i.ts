      Oils have always been more than food, more than fragrance. They are condensed light, concentrated
      essence, and carriers of subtle energy. Olive oil, myrrh, cinnamon, cassia, and calamus were not chosen
      randomly—they were encoded with meaning, each herb and oil reflecting a quality of life, awareness, and
      inner discipline.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      The outer oil was a tangible ritual: applied to kings, priests, and sacred objects to signal their alignment
      with higher frequencies. The inner oil is subtler: the secretion of the pineal and pituitary glands,
      harmonized with lunar cycles, producing awareness, intuition, and perception. This inner chrism is precious,
      and its preservation is a skill.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      The mirror of outer and inner teaches that the body is the temple, the brain is the altar, and oils are bridges
      connecting matter and consciousness. Science today confirms what ancient wisdom intuited: compounds in
      plants affect cognition, mood, and physiology. Myrrh stabilizes, cinnamon excites, cassia grounds, calamus
      clarifies, and olive oil nourishes the vessel.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      To cultivate the inner anointing is to recognize the body as sacred and the mind as a temple. Simple rituals
      —touching oil, inhaling scents, meditative focus—align matter, mind, and spirit. Together, they create
      continuity between ancient practice and modern awareness. The oil of heaven and Earth is not a relic: it is
      alive, waiting to be engaged by those who notice.
